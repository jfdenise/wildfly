Welcome to the WildFly Documentation. The documentation for WildFly is
split into multiple categories:

* _Installation Guides_ for those wanting to understand the flexibility 
that WildFly offers when it comes to server installation and application deployment.

* _Administrator Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to install
and configure the server

* _Developer Guides_ for those wanting to understand how to develop
applications for the server

* _Model Reference_ the WildFly Model Reference provides information about all subsystem
configuration options generated directly from the management model.

* _Security Guide_ for those wanting to understand how to secure WildFly server and applications.

* _Client Guide_ for those wanting to understand WildFly client.

* _Quickstarts_ for those wanting to jump on code and start using WildFly.

RESTful web services and more. Finally, you'll get the opportunity to create
your own skeleton project. Each tutorial is accompanied by a quickstart,
which contains the source code, deployment descriptors and a Maven based
build.

link:Getting_Started_Developing_Applications_Guide{outfilesuffix}[Getting Started
Developing Applications Guide], and shows you how to build a complex
application using Jakarta EE and portable extensions.

* The link:Extending_WildFly{outfilesuffix}[Extending WildFly] guide walks you
through creating a new WildFly subsystem extension, in order to add more
functionality to WildFly, and shows how to test it before plugging it
